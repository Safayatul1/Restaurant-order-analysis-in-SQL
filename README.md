## Project Overview
This repository contains SQL scripts for setting up and analyzing a restaurant database. The project includes:
- `create_restaurant_db.sql`: A script to create and structure the restaurant database.
- `Restaurant Order Analysis.sql`: An SQL script performing data analysis on restaurant orders.

## Files in this Repository

### Database Creation Script
`create_restaurant_db.sql`
- Creates necessary tables for restaurant management.
- Defines relationships between tables (e.g., `orders`, `menu_items`, `customers`).
- Ensures proper constraints and indexing for performance.

### Order Analysis Script
`Restaurant Order Analysis.sql`
- Executes queries to analyze restaurant order patterns.
- Provides insights such as:
